This is a repository containing source code for my personal website.
This is a project I have undertaken in my free time to have a creative
outlet and something to keep me busy.

I intend on developing this website using reactjs.
To run this app on a dev server run the command "npm start" in the project's
root directory. To build this app for deployment run the command "npm run
build" in the projects root directory. The resulting build will be in the
dist directory.

Here is a list of a few things planned for this website.

### About Page
Here I intend on telling the user all about myself. I will include pictures
of me doing things I enjoy and allow the user to learn about me.

### Contact Page
On this page I intend on giving the user useful information on how to contact
me. I will also give a download for my resume.

### Photos
This page should be self explanatory. I intend on having a page where I am
able to display my photos that I have taken for all to see.

### Games
This will be the most fun page of all. Here I will upload games and other
miscellaneous things I have created for the user to interact with.

### Blog
Here I plan on posting small blog posts where I can update the users with
what I have been up to and to what my recent thoughts are. I intend on
posting book and movie reviews if I feel so inclined to do so.
